Welcome to the Communications Hill [Neighborhood Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_association) in beautiful [San Jose, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jose,_California)!

We hope to create a unified voice within our large community and celebrate together with events throughout the year.

We are NOT a homeowners association. We do not impose rules or restrictions, but we do meet regularly to come up with ways to improve life in our neighborhood.
