California High Speed Rail The California High Speed Rail is currently planned to follow the existing Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way through Communications Hill. See the “San Jose to Merced” on the CA HSR website for more details. The section that affects Communications Hill is incorrectly referred to as “Monterey Corridor” in their documents (the real Monterey Corridor is north of Seven Trees, east of Monterey Ave, and south of Spartan Keyes). Search for “Monterey Corridor” in this document to get an overview of how the HSR impacts the hill for each proposed alternative. Canoas Creek Trail A new bicycle trail is planned to follow Canoas Creek from the Highway 87 Bikeway to the Blossom Hill VTA Station. More details are available on the San Jose City website. For a rough idea of what the proposed alignment is, view the relation on OpenStreetMap. Capitol Caltrain Station Pedestrian Bridge A pedestrian bridge is proposed to link Hillsdale Station Rd. (and Communications Hill trail) with the Capitol Caltrain Station. More information can be found in the specific plan under the heading “ADP Improvement 8”.

Design work for the bridge is planned in phase 3, while construction is planned for phase 4 (see construction schedule notes for the KB Home residential construction above). Capitol VTA Light Rail Station Transit Oriented Development Redevelopment of the Park \u0026 Ride lot at the Capital VTA Light Rail station is still in the early planning phases at the time of this writing.

Here’s a few tips: San Jose has a litter cleanup program that you can signup for. They’ll give you some basic equipment free-of-charge. Basic recommended equipment (in order of importance): Tough trash bags that can handle sitting outside for a few days without falling apart. An ergonomic grabber tool. Non-ergonomic grabber tools will still work, but will hurt your hand after a half hour or so. The grabber tools provided by the city may not look like much, but they’re much better than what you’ll get at most hardware stores (the common Unger ones mostly work fine, but they tend to bend and have alignment problems). Gloves that are tough, but cheap enough that you don’t mind getting rid of them if they get really nasty. Bulk cheap garden gloves from your local hardware store will work fine. A box cutter (recommendation can be found here). If you pickup litter along the trail, leaving your bags of litter (securely tied of course) next to the public trash cans seems to result in the bags being removed by the city without issue. However, you may wish to contact the city for an official recommendation on where to leave bags of litter you pick up. Please create an issue on github if you know of a better process to use for disposal of bags of litter.
